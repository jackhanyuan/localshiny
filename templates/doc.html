        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown"><strong>bookdown</strong></a> package is a free and open-source R package built on top of <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> to make it really easy to write books and long-form articles/reports. Markdown is a very simple language but made powerful thanks to <a href="http://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>, and <strong>bookdown</strong> has added a few important missing features related to writing books, such as figure/table caption numbering and cross-references, and embedding <a href="https://htmlwidgets.org">HTML widgets</a> or <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com">Shiny apps</a>. We have tried hard to make everything work for all output formats (PDF, HTML, and EPUB, etc), so your readers can choose their favorite file format to read. Although the <strong>bookdown</strong> package was developed using R, it does not mean your book have to be related to R at all. You can certainly write poems or novels with <strong>bookdown</strong>!</p>
